 * The basic approach in Insertion Sort is that we start from second element and check that all the elements before
 * it are smaller than it. If not, we will insert the current element before the greater element to ensure every element before
 * current element is smaller.
 * The only catch here is that if an element is smaller than the current element we don't need to go forward and check the
 * elements before it since they will be already smaller than the element so we can break the loop there itself.
 * That's why insertion sort can give O(n) complexity.
